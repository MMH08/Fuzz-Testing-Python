    "# Introduction to Fuzzing\n",
    "- Fuzz Testing is a type of testing where automated or semi-automated testing techniques are used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software.\n",
    "- Fuzz testing was originally developed by Barton Miller at the University of Wisconsin in 1989. Fuzz testing or fuzzing is a Software testing technique, and it is a type of Security Testing.\n",

    "### Why we do Fuzz testing?\n",
    "- Fuzz testing is used to check the Vulnerability of software. It is very cost effective testing techniques.\n",
    "- Fuzz testing is one of the black box testing technique. \n",
    "- Fuzzing is one of the most common method hackers used to find vulnerability of the system.\n",

We record the line coverage score is maximum 42 for non-API based mutation fuzzer and maximum 44 for the API-based mutation fuzzer.

    "### Random fuzzer() Vs mutation based coverage-guided fuzzer()\n",
    "In terms of generating inputs, Random fuzzer is not a good approach to generate smarter inputs because it always generate the invalid inputs. Therefore, the percentage of the valid input generation is 0%. On the other hand, API based mutation fuzzer could be good approach because it can generate maximum 40% valid inputs. However, in terms of our prime number program, if we customize or follow non-API based mutation fuzzer by considering three customized (i.e., use only number from ascii character from decimal value 48 to 57) program delete_random_char(), add_random_char(), flip_random_character() then we can generate maximum 70% of valid inputs. However, we can make more improvement (100%) if we do not consider this flip_random_character() function or if we customize more flip_random_character() function because this function use randint() built-in function, therefore 9 is the last digit of number in ascii table, so after flipping the character randomly from 0-5 using randint(0, 5) it flip to the other non numeric character and completely make non-numeric input as a whole.      \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of coverage, if we would try to do line and branch coverager with the purely random fuzzer then the program promtly crashed because random fuzzer could not generate valid inputs as a whole. So we tried to focus on the mutation fuzzer with API-based calling and non API-based calling (that means we customize the fuzzer by adding, deleting and flipping a character from the inputs). In terms of line coverage, We record the score of line coverage is maximum 42 for non-API based mutation fuzzer and maximum 44 for the API-based mutation fuzzer. For branch coverage, we got more branch coverage (max-51) from API-based mutation fuzzer compared to non-API based mutation fuzzer (custmized mutation fuzzer) that is maximum 48 for 2000 trials. In conclution, API-based mutation fuzzer inputs are covering more line and branch compared to non-API based mutation fuzzer inputs. \n"
